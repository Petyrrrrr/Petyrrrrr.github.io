I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at Princeton [ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/). I'm honored to be supported by [the Francis Robbins Upton Fellowship](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/financial-support/fellowships/princeton-fellowships/francis-robbins-upton-fellowship). I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Boris Hanin](https://boris-hanin.github.io/) and Prof. [Jianqing Fan](https://fan.princeton.edu/).

I recently graduated from [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) with a double major in Math and CS. At MIT I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Guy Bresler](https://www.mit.edu/~gbresler/) and Prof. [Yury Polyanskiy]([https://math.mit.edu/~nsun/](https://people.lids.mit.edu/yp/homepage/)) on projects in theoretical statistics and computer science. 

I grew up in [Shanghai](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1Z2Pj5MLH3/?hl=en), China, and went to [PRISMS](https://prismsus.org/) for high school in Princeton, NJ. You can find my CV [here](../assets/Tianze_CV_2501.pdf).

Research interests
======
I'm generally interested in the intersection of statistics, theoretical computer science, machine learning, and applied probability. Some of my current interests include deep learning theory (in particular, scaling limits of large networks) and random matrix theory. 

Much of my past work happened at the intersection of theoretical CS and statistics where I explored non-asymptotic and high-dimensional inference problems and their average-case complexity. I try to come up with efficient algorithms to solve average-case statistical problems or prove respective lower bounds. 

I'm also broadly interested in many related fields. On the theory side, I'm interested in using insights from (statistical) physics in learning. On another more practical end, I'm interested in almost all aspects of Large Language Models.
