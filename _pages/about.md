I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at Princeton [ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/). I'm honored to be supported by [the Francis Robbins Upton Fellowship](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/financial-support/fellowships/princeton-fellowships/francis-robbins-upton-fellowship). I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Boris Hanin](https://boris-hanin.github.io/).

I graduated from [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) in 2024 with a double major in Math and CS. At MIT I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Guy Bresler](https://www.mit.edu/~gbresler/) and Prof. [Yury Polyanskiy]([https://math.mit.edu/~nsun/](https://people.lids.mit.edu/yp/homepage/)) on projects in theoretical statistics and computer science. 

I grew up in [Shanghai](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1Z2Pj5MLH3/?hl=en), China, and went to [PRISMS](https://prismsus.org/) for high school in Princeton, NJ. You can find my CV [here](../assets/Tianze_CV_2504.pdf).

Research interests
======
I'm interested in the theory of deep learning from the perspectives of statistical physics, theoretical computer science, and probability. A broad current project I'm working on is about analyzing scaling limits of deep networks via tools from random matrix theory. 

Much of my past work at MIT happened at the intersection of theoretical CS and statistics, where I explored non-asymptotic and high-dimensional inference problems and their average-case complexity. 

I'm also broadly interested in many related fields, including empirically understanding transformers and language models.
