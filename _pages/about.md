I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at MIT, studying Math, CS, and Statistics. I grew up in Shanghai, China, and went to [PRISMS](https://prismsus.org/) for high school in Princeton, NJ.

Research interests
======
Hey I'm interested in a lot of things.

Some ongoing thoughts
======
* Compression and Prediction
  * We can write a formula that turns any nice compression coding into a decent prediction algorithm, but is there a generic lower bound saying that if compression is hard, so is prediction?
  * Can any efficient compression algorithm beat high-order Markov transition estimation on simple models such as HMMs?

* Learnability of Random Nets
  * It is known that fully random nets are easier to learn than adversarial nets. But what happens at the intermediate ‘smoothed’ settings?
  * We have a set of nice tools on proving lower bounds with feed-forward nets. How about transformers?

* Diffusion models
  * Can you run diffusion for a shorter amount of time and generate something that is 'pseudo'-valid (a.k.a. 'shortcut sampling')?
  * Can you shortcut starting at a noise ratio so low that efficient denoising algorithms start to function?

* Average-case reductions
  * We have some wonderful results matching moments with dense graphs from the Planted Clique model. Can one do something in the sparse regime?
  * Is there some clever way to show that signal recovery in the planted community problem is strictly harder than detection?

Some past projects

* I have done some interesting works.
