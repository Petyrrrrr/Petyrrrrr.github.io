I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at Princeton [ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/). I'm honored to be supported by [the Francis Robbins Upton Fellowship](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/financial-support/fellowships/princeton-fellowships/francis-robbins-upton-fellowship). I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Boris Hanin](https://boris-hanin.github.io/).

I graduated from [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) in 2024 with a double major in Math and CS. At MIT I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Guy Bresler](https://www.mit.edu/~gbresler/) and Prof. [Yury Polyanskiy]([https://math.mit.edu/~nsun/](https://people.lids.mit.edu/yp/homepage/)) on projects in theoretical statistics and computer science. 

I grew up in Shanghai, China, and went to [PRISMS](https://prismsus.org/) for high school in Princeton, NJ. You can find my CV [here](../assets/Tianze_CV_2510.pdf).

Research interests
======
I’m interested in studying deep learning theoretically and empirically using methods from mathematical physics, statistics, and
probability. At the moment, I'm broadly thinking about analyzing the scaling limits and scaling law of deep networks, as well as the role of parametrization, quantization, and optimizers. 

Much of my past work at MIT happened at the intersection of theoretical CS and statistics, where I explored non-asymptotic and high-dimensional inference problems and their average-case complexity.
