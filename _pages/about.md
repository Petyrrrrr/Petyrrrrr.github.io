I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at Princeton [ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/). I'm honored to be supported by [the Francis Robbins Upton Fellowship](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/financial-support/fellowships/princeton-fellowships/francis-robbins-upton-fellowship).

I recently graduated from [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) with a double major in Math and CS. At MIT I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Guy Bresler](https://www.mit.edu/~gbresler/) and Prof. [Yury Polyanskiy]([https://math.mit.edu/~nsun/](https://people.lids.mit.edu/yp/homepage/)). 

I grew up in [Shanghai](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1Z2Pj5MLH3/?hl=en), China, and went to [PRISMS](https://prismsus.org/) for high school in Princeton, NJ. My CV is [here](../assets/Tianze_CV_0823.pdf).

Research interests
======
I'm generally interested in the intersection of statistics, computer science, combinatorics, and applied probability. Much of my past work happened at the intersection of theoretical CS and statistics where I explored non-asymptotic and high-dimensional inference problems and their average-case complexity. I try to come up with efficient algorithms to solve average-case statistical problems or prove respective lower bounds. 

I'm also broadly interested in many related fields. On the theory side, I'm interested in using insights from (statistical) physics on learning. On another more practical end, I'm trying to keep up with the constantly evolving progress on attention models.
